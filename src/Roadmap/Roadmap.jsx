      <p>This roadmap is aimed at helping entry-level software engineering jobs aspirants at top tech product-based companies and startups.</p>
      <h5>Note: Please watch this video in order to understand in depth what to do precisely.</h5>
      <p>
      More precisely, this will help you clear interviews of SDE 1 roles for almost all popular product based companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Flipkart, and startups like Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, etc. 

      The guide focuses on almost all parts of interview rounds divided across 90 days in order of priority levels. Even if you complete the first 45 days of roadmap, you should be confident enough to start appearing for interviews.

      Assumption: We have assumed that you have the basic foundation or know at least any one programming language very well. If not, we recommend you to learn any one of C++, Java, Python, or any other object-oriented programming language and then start with the roadmap.
